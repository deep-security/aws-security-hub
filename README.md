# Project Retired

Thank you for your interest in this integration between Trend Micro’s Deep Security and [AWS Security Hub](https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/). This integration was created early in the product lifecycle of AWS Security Hub and was made available during the preview phase of the service.

During the preview phase, this integration was tested in a number of scenarios with an assortment of customers. Based on those experiences, we’re retiring this integration as we look at ways to make the overall experience smoother and the focus on generating actionable findings.

If you have a use case you’d like to highlight to the team or feedback on these efforts, please email aws@trendmicro.com.
